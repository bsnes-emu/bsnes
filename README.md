The official bsnes repository
===============================

bsnes emulates the Super Famicom and Super Nintendo consoles,
including various peripherals,
allowing you to play classic games on a modern general-purpose computer.

The name "bsnes" originally referred to a standalone SNES emulator.
Later, bsnes added support for other classic game consoles,
then in v091 it was renamed "higan".
higan still exists, and still includes SNES emulation,
but for people who don't want or need all the other emulators,
as of v107 the SNES emulation is once again
available on its own as "bsnes".

Basically,
apart from `.gitignore` files,
anything in the
[bsnes](bsnes/),
[hiro](hiro/),
[icarus](icarus/),
[libco](libco/),
[nall](nall/),
[ruby](ruby/),
or [shaders](shaders/)
directories should be exactly as it appeared in official releases.
Everything else has been added for various reasons.
