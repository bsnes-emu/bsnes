## Compiling instructions

If you want to compile by yourself, it's also very easy to. Just follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

 * Updated C/C++ compilation suite already installed and with enviroment paths ready for your operational system 
For Windows, we can suggest [MinGW] (http://mingw-w64.org/).
Another good suggestion [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). It also has versions for MacOS and Linux (and even come in some distributions).
 * (optional) [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Generating the executable

1. Open a command prompt in your directory of choice and clone the most recent version of the code in a directory of your choice.
  * you can get it ready manually just extracting the source code (that you can download just clicking in the "Code" button and choosing "download zip") in your directory of choice
  * if you have Git installed, you can do it with the command prompt/terminal:
  `git clone https://github.com/bsnes-emu/bsnes.git`

2. Go to `bsnes` folder with: `cd bsnes`.

3. Now you just need to put the command: `make` (for most of C/C++ compilation suites) or `mingw32-make`(if you're using Windows MinGW). The compilation will start.

4. The brand new compiled file will be at directory `./bsnes/out`. Enjoy!
