    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>kaijuu is a Windows context menu shell extension. The context
    menu is the list you see when you right-click on a file or folder.
    kaijuu allows you to add your own custom actions to this menu.</p>

    <p>Think of opening an unknown file type: Windows will ask you to
    associate a program with the file type. From there forward,
    double-clicking the file will open the file with that program.</p>

    <p>kaijuu is a far more powerful version of this same concept. With
    kaijuu, you can assign as many rules as you want. You can apply the
    same rule to multiple file patterns. You can have more complex
    pattern matching for names. You can apply rules to folders. You can
    specify rules about how to handle single-file versus multi-file
    selection. You can send custom command-line parameters to the
    program. You can have rules on a per-user basis. And you can do all
    of this from an easy-to-use GUI.</p>

    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>kaijuu comes in 32-bit and 64-bit flavors, you will need to use
    the one for your operating system. If you are unsure, try running
    kaijuu32.exe. It will tell you if you need to use the 64-bit
    version.</p>

    <p>Now place the appropriate kaijuu EXE and DLL files into a folder
    where you intend to keep them. The DLL cannot be moved after
    installation, otherwise Explorer will not be able to locate the
    shell extension. C:\Program Files\kaijuu would be a recommended
    location.</p>

    <p>Now run the kaijuu EXE, and click on <i>Install</i>. You must
    have administrator access to use the kaijuu EXE, as this is
    necessary to install and uninstall shell extensions.</p>

    <h3>Removal and Upgrading</h3>
    <p>To remove or upgrade kaijuu, you must first uninstall the shell
    extension. Run the kaijuu EXE, and click on <i>Uninstall</i>. You
    must now close all open instances of Windows Explorer, in order for
    the DLL to be completely unloaded. In the worst case, restart the
    computer.</p>

    <p>If you intend to upgrade kaijuu, I recommend using the
    <i>Reset</i> button to erase all saved settings. There is no
    guarantee of backward-compatibility between kaijuu revisions.</p>

    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>The kaijuu EXE not only handles installation and removal, it also
    handles modifying the rules.</p>

    <p>kaijuu stores a unique list of rules for every user account.
    You are free to modify rules even while kaijuu is installed. They
    will take immediate effect.</p>

    <p>The main interface lists all rules, sorted in order of their
    priority. For instance, if two rules match and both are marked as
    the default action; the item higher in the list will be marked as
    the default. You can also quickly determine if the extension is
    currently installed.</p>

    <p><i>Append</i> will add new rules, <i>Modify</i> will edit an
    existing rule, <i>Move Up</i> and <i>Move Down</i> can be used to
    modify the priority ordering, <i>Remove</i> can delete the selected
    rule, and <i>Reset</i> can delete all rules.</p>

    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>You can have as many rules as you like. You will see every
    matched rule in the context menu when you right-click on files or
    folders.</p>

    <p><i>Name</i> is the string that will show up in the context menu.
    It would be wise to name the rule something like "Open with X" or
    "Edit with Y"</p>

    <p><i>Pattern</i> is a semicolon-separated list of patterns to test
    the selected file or folder names against. You must specify one or
    more patterns.</p>

    <p><b>Example 1:</b> <i>*.txt;*.doc</i> will match anything ending
    in <i>.txt</i> <i>or</i> in <i>.doc</i>.</p>

    <p><b>Example 2:</b> <i>*</i> will match everything always.</p>

    <p><b>Example 3:</b> <i>Manifest</i> will only match items named
    <i>Manifest</i>.</p>

    <p><b>Example 4:</b> <i>*.??</i> will match any two-letter
    extension, such as <i>.gb</i></p>

    <i>Command</i> is the program to be executed when a rule is
    activated. You can use the <i>Select</i> button to quickly navigate
    to a program to use.</p>

    <p>Note the way the program name is typically quoted, for instance
    <i>"c:\my program.exe"</i>. If there is a space in the path, this is
    required to differentiate the program name from its arguments. If
    you were to type your own rule, you could take advantage of two
    things: first, the <i>PATH</i> command-line variable allows
    specifying system programs without the full path. For instance,
    <i>"cmd"</i> will invoke the command-prompt; and second, if the
    program path contains no spaces, the quotes are no longer necessary.
    So you could say <i>cmd</i> to invoke the command-prompt.</p>

    <p>After the program name, you can specify the program arguments.
    kaijuu has many special identifiers built-in, that are replaced with
    the file and/or folder names that were selected. When using the
    <i>Select</i> button, <i>{file}</i> is automatically appended for
    convenience, which should be sufficient for most cases. You can of
    course customize the rule afterward with the following identifiers:
    </p>

<pre>
{name}      = c:\path\file.txt
{pathname}  = c:\path
{filename}  = file.txt
{basename}  = file
{extension} = txt

{path}  = "c:\path"
{file}  = "c:\path\file.txt"

{paths} = "c:\path1" "c:\path2"
{files} = "c:\path1\file1.txt" "c:\path2\file2.txt"
</pre>

    <p>Note that if you use the first group, you must add your own
    quotes around the identifiers, eg <i>notepad "{name}"</i>.</p>

    <p>If the command includes <i>{files}</i> or <i>{paths}</i> within
    the string, then kaijuu will match this rule when one or more files
    are selected. If neither of these patterns are found, then kaijuu
    will only check the rule if a single file is selected.</p>

    <p>You will want to use <i>{file}</i> and <i>{path}</i> for programs
    that can only open a single item a a time; and <i>{files}</i> and
    <i>{paths}</i> for programs that can open multiple items at the same
    time, such as music players.</p>

    <p><i>Default Action</i>, when checked, will mark this rule as the
    default action to take when a file or folder is double-clicked on.
    </p>

    <p><i>Match Files</i> will allow selections with files in them to
    be valid. If a file is selected without this checked, the rule will
    fail.</p>

    <p><i>Match Folders</i> will allow selections with folders in them
    to be valid. If a file is selected without this checked, the rule
    will fail.</p>

    <p><i>Assign</i> will create the new rule or modify an existing
    rule, depending upon which button you clicked from the main window.
    </p>

    <p><b>Caution:</b> be very careful when using a pattern of <i>*</i>
    along with <i>Default Action</i> checked. For instance, you could
    find that double-clicking executables no longer opens then, and
    requires you to use the right-click context menu. In the worst case,
    you will have to reboot into safe mode and delete the rule or kaijuu
    DLL.</p>
